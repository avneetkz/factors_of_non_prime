# Factors of non-prime number
This repository will first check whether the number entered by user is prime or not. If the number is prime, it will ask for a composite(non-prime) number and if the number is composite, it will give the factors of the respective number. 

## What are prime and composite numbers
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. On the other hand, a composite number is a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying two smaller positive integers.

## What is factor 
The factor of a number is a number that divides the given number completely without any remainder. Division and multiplication are the operations that are used in finding the factors of a number.
